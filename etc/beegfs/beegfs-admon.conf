#
# --- Section 2: [Command Line Arguments] ---
#

# Use the command line argument "cfgFile=/etc/anotherconfig.conf" to
# specify a different config file for beegfs_admon.
# All other options in this file can also be used as command line
# arguments, overriding the corresponding config file values.


#
# --- Section 3: [Basic Settings Documentation] ---
#

# [sysMgmtdHost]
# Hostname (or IP) of the host running the management service.
# (See also "connMgmtdPortUDP" and "connMgmtdPortTCP")
# Default: <none>


#
# --- Section 4: [Advanced Settings Documentation] ---
#

#
# --- Section 4.1: [Admon] ---
#

# [clearDatabase]
# Defines whether the database file should be deleted on startup.
# Default: false

# [httpPort]
# The TCP port on which the built-in webserver will listen for incoming HTTP
# connections.
# Default: 8000

# [databaseFile]
# The path to the database file.
# Default: /var/lib/beegfs/beegfs-admon.db

# [queryInterval]
# The interval (number of seconds) after which the servers will be queried for
# new statistics data.
# Default: 5


#
# --- Section 4.2: [Connections & Communication] ---
#

# [connAdmonPortUDP]
# The UDP port of the admon.
# Default: 8007

# [connMgmtdPortTCP], [connMgmtdPortUDP]
# The UDP and TCP ports of the management node.
# Default: 8008

# [connPortShift]
# Shifts all following UDP and TCP ports according to the specified value.
# Intended to make port configuration easier in case you do not want to
# configure each port individually.
# Default: 0

# [connAuthFile]
# The path to a file that contains a shared secret for connection based
# authentication. Only peers that use the same shared secret will be able to
# connect.
# Default: <none>

# [connFallbackExpirationSecs]
# The time in seconds after which a connection to a fallback interface expires.
# When a fallback connection expires, the system will try to establish a new
# connection to the other hosts  primary interface (falling back to another
# interface again if necessary).
# Note: The priority of node interfaces can be configured using the
#    "connInterfacesFile" parameter.
# Default: 900

# [connMaxInternodeNum]
# The maximum number of simultaneous connections to the same node.
# Default: 3

# [connInterfacesFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies the names of the interfaces, which
# may be used for communication by other nodes. One interface per line. The
# line number also defines the priority of an interface.
# Example: "ib0" in the first line, "eth0" in the second line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all available interfaces
#    will be published and priorities will be assigned automatically.
# Note: This has no influence on outgoing connections. The information is sent
#    to other hosts to inform them about possible communication paths.
# Default: <none>

# [connNetFilterFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies allowed IP subnets, which may be used
# for outgoing communication. One subnet per line in classless notation (IP
# address and number of significant bits).
# Example: "192.168.10.0/24" in the first line, "192.168.20.0/24" in the second
#    line.
# Values: This setting is optional. If unspecified, all addresses are allowed
#    for outgoing communication.
# Default: <none>

# [connTcpOnlyFilterFile]
# The path to a text file that specifies IP address ranges to which no RDMA 
# connection should be established. This is useful e.g. for environments where
# all hosts support RDMA, but some hosts cannot connect via RDMA to some other
# hosts.
# Example: "192.168.10.0/24" in the first line, "192.168.20.0/24" in the second
#    line.
# Values: This setting is optional.
# Default: <none>

#
# --- Section 4.3: [Logging] ---
#

# [logType]
# Defines the logger type. This can either be "syslog" to send log messages to
# the general system logger or "logfile". If set to logfile logs will be written 
# to logStdFile.
# Default: logfile

# [logLevel]
# Defines the amount of output messages. The higher this level, the more
# detailed the log messages will be.
# Note: Levels above 2 might decrease performance.
# Default: 2 (Max: 5)

# [logNoDate]
# Defines whether "date & time" (=false) or the current "time only" (=true)
# should be logged.
# Default: false

# [logNumLines]
# The maximum number of lines per log file.
# Default: 50000

# [logNumRotatedFiles]
# The number of old files to keep when "logNumLines" is reached and the log file
# is rewritten. (Log rotation)
# Default: 2

# [logStdFile]
# The path and filename of the log file for standard log messages. 
# The parameter will be considered only if logType value is not equal to 
# syslog. If no name is specified, the messages will be written to the console.
# Default: /var/log/beegfs-admon.log


#
#--- Section 4.4: [eMail notification] ---
#

# [mailEnabled]
# Enables the email notification. The configurations from this file will 
# override the configurations from the admon GUI.
# Default: false

# [mailSmtpSendType]
# How to send the email to an smtp server.
# Values:
#   * socket: use a socket to send the mails to an SMTP server without user 
#             authentication.
#   * sendmail: use the installed and configured sendmail program to send mails. 
#               The sendmail binary should be accessible by the default binary 
#               search path of the system.
# Note: Use sendmail if a encrypted connection to the SMTP server and/or user 
#       authentication is required.
# Default: socket

# [mailSendmailPath]
# The path to the sendmail binary. This configuration is only required when 
# mailSmtpSendType is set to sendmail.
# Note: If the binary is accessible by the default binary search path of the 
# system the default configuration works.
# Default: sendmail

# [mailCheckIntervalTimeSec]
# Amount of time to check for new events which must be notified in seconds.
# Default: 30

# [mailMinDownTimeSec]
# Minimum amount of time between a event and the email notification in seconds. 
# The minimal downtime of a node before it must be notified.
# Default: 10

# The recipient addresses to which notifications are sent.
# Default: <none>

# [mailResendMailTimeMin]
# Amount of time after which an already sent email is resent as reminder in 
# minutes.

# Default: <none>

# [mailSmtpServer]
# SMTP server to use for sending eMails.

# Default: true


#
# --- Section 4.6: [Tuning] ---
#

# [tuneNumWorkers]
# The number of worker threads. Should be at least 3. A value of up to twice the
# number of CPU cores of your machine is the recommended choice.
# Default: 4
