Simple example of serving zpool_prometheus metrics using Flask

Note: if for some reason the zpool_prometheus program hangs, then
the results are undefined. When planning for production, expect
that the worst case is zpool_prometheus hangs in the kernel and is
not killable.

Prerequisites:
 + zpool_prometheus executable in $PATH
 + Flask is installed in the python libraries (eg pip install Flask)

To run, for testing:
  FLASK_APP=serve_zpool_prometheus.py python -m flask run

To test:
  curl localhost:5000

Pro tip: use a real WSGI server for production with proper security policies.

For the impatient: by default, flask binds only to localhost port 5000. To
allow access from elsewhere or change port, use the --host and --port options.
You can also set the FLASK_APP as an environment variable:
  export FLASK_APP=serve_zpool_prometheus.py
  python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

See Flask docs for more information on options
